This is a Haskell binding to the ZooKeeper C library.  A simple usage example
is included in src/ZooClient.hs.

If you've installed zookeeper in a non-standard location (which seems pretty
common for zookeeper), you'll need to run cabal configure with
--extra-include-dirs and --extra-lib-dirs pointing to where you installed the
zookeeper headers and libraries.
